Registering

You can not directly register on |site_name| currently. If you or your organization
want to upload data to |site_name|, please send an email with the subject line titled
"|site_name|: Apply for an Organization" to data.contact AT depositar.io providing
the following information:

.. hint::

   We provide a demo system at https://demo.depositar.io with the same features
   as |site_name| for evaluation purposes. You can create an account and try
   any functions provided by |site_name|. Please note that all data in this instance
   will be deleted occasionally.

  The created organization will be located at

   For ease of management, we will create a new CKAN ``organizaion`` for each person or
   organization to upload datasets. You can learn how to fill in the information above by
   referring to `existing organizations <https://data.depositar.io/organization>`_.

You will receive your results as shown below within 72 hours. And, you are the administrator
of the new organization.

Invite others to organization
=============================

If you want to invite others to collaborate on datasets, you can invite them to your organization.
From the organization’s page you should see an “Admin” button above the search box.
When you select this, CKAN displays the organization admin page.

Select the "Members" tab, and you will see the organization members page.
Then select the "Add Member" button.

Then CKAN will send an invitation email to his/her.
